          <h2>Enterprice</h2>
          <p>Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. Now, how the hell do we defeat an enemy that knows us better than we know ourselves? We finished our first sensor sweep of the neutral zone. Mr. Worf, you sound like a man who's asking his friend if he can start dating his sister. Talk about going nowhere fast. What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? I am your worst nightmare! You did exactly what you had to do. You considered all your options, you tried every alternative and then you made the hard choice. Maybe if we felt any human loss as keenly as we feel one of those close to us, human history would be far less bloody. Did you come here for something in particular or just general Riker-bashing? Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Worf, It's better than music. It's jazz. The unexpected is our normal routine. This is not about revenge. This is about justice. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Fate protects fools, little children and ships named Enterprise.</p>

          <h2>The Bear</h2>
          <p>Some days you get the bear, and some days the bear gets you. When has justice ever been as simple as a rule book? Flair is what marks the difference between artistry and mere competence. You're going to be an interesting companion, Mr. Data. Is it my imagination, or have tempers become a little frayed on the ship lately? Your head is not an artifact! Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Earl Grey tea, watercress sandwiches... and Bularian canapés? Are you up for promotion? That might've been one of the shortest assignments in the history of Starfleet. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? I've had twelve years to think about it. And if I had it to do over again, I would have grabbed the phaser and pointed it at you instead of them. I'll alert the crew. My oath is between Captain Kargan and myself. Your only concern is with how you obey my orders. Or do you prefer the rank of prisoner to that of lieutenant? Travel time to the nearest starbase?</p>
